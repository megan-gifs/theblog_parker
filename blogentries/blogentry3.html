      <p> Am I cramming this blog post to finish the website in time to submit at 1:02AM?? Pshhh... no. The 2 other blog posts have been stream of consciousness so this will be no different. We gotta talk about restaurants in the city (San Francisco). I swear to god there are so many places now that are just "vibe" prisons. Fake ivy plant hanging on the wall, neon sign that says some childlike adage about tequila. Or the new and improved "wine bar" culture. Now, without being too cynical I actually really enjoy the latter. Mid-century modern furniture is always beautiful and well designed, ambient overhead diffused lighting is pretty, Tiling and Woodgrain are classic and look nice. I think what scares me the most is just how everything looks so similar. I swear I pass the new "wine bar" type spot every week. On the weekend theres a coffee store pop up, a vintage reseller, a jewelry maker, someone selling prints, etc. etc. Listen, I think community building, third spaces, and all of that is incredibly valuable and needs to be cherished. I just sometimes question if people like the spaces they create, or like being seen in the spaces they create. Is it the simple fact that you like this interior design, or is it rather that your interest in these things, or that your presence in this place, or the photo that you take of yourself in that space, implies something about yourself. I don't think that any of these things takes away from the space, I just think its a bit funny sometimes. Motoring Coffee comes to mind. Its a small cafe that has vintage cars on display in the Cafe. However, the coffee is quite mediocre and you are required a membership to take photos with the cars or see more of the cars. It seems kinda silly to me. I love a good vibe, I love well designed spaces, EVEN IF they're trendy. I think it's sometimes just a plain bummer if they all look and feel so similar. Not to mention, it'll be like 20 bucks for a burger! </br></br>
        I decided to use the rest of this blog post to talk about the things swirling in my mind for the future of my own web design, as I near completion for this assignment and prototype 1 of this website. I will say, being now able to conceive of websites as bundles of files and text files is so interesting to me. We view these things like places. Youtube to me, feels like a space. Instagram to me, feels like a space. What is going on here? Without repeating the monotone adages everyone repeats about social media sites, I think the concept of a website being a place is so fascinating to me. In the future, I want to move forward with this idea. I want to create sites that feel hyper real, sites with absurd ads with uncanny functions and descriptions. I think that the more a site feels personalized, the more it feels custom the better. I want to play around more with graphics on websites, as I feel like thats the biggest thing holding me back. I don't quite know whats next for me in designing websites but I know I will make more. I can only hope when you've been using my site so far, you feel like you're in a space.
