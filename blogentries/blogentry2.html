      <p>This blog post borders on pretentiousness. Don't listen to me! But, I write again! Not my favorite thing to do but I return. I have been thinking a lot lately about people who create art, or the godforsaken 'artist.' Referring to myself as an artist makes me want to coil into myself like a snake. I think it's because there are many, many, many individuals who want to look like an artist, they want to claim the lifestyle of an artist, without putting in the actual work to be an artist. They claim this weird imagined silhouette of someone they think would be cooler than them</br></br>A few days ago, after 2 beers and over a game of pool, I was speaking with a friend about who would actually make it artistically. Everyone wants to paint, everyone wants to draw, especially for a living. However, we were discussing the people that we knew, that we believed were going to be genuinely successful, fully independent artists. If this comes off as a judgemental conversation, forgive me. I kinda care about art. We both circled around to a similar thought. Art is a field that attracts a lot of free, 'heady', no limits, imaginitive types. People with fantastic ideas, with fantastical philosophies, with deeply sensitive hearts are the people who pursue art. But ironically, to be a fine artist, takes that absolute unwavering Type-A grinding demeanor. To actually be successful (whatever the hell that means) as an 'artist' (whatever the hell that means) it takes an amount of personal discipline incomparable to other fields. You are your own mentor, instructor, boss, assistant, coworker, resource, accountability partner, etc. You must sharpen your skills to razor fine abilities, to a narrow niche that can make you money. And quite a few connections. And it's gonna fucking suck. Until maybe you're like 30? Then you might reap. But who knows? I have these thoughts and I'm a barely ripened 23 year old silly guy. I am not speaking from a place of authority, just my understanding of things. </br></br> OK OK OK OK OK Website update!! I'm basically all done, just finishing up some blog posts... I have put such an insane amount of work into this website I can't even begin to list to you the things I have accomplished. I am so proud of where I've ended up here. I have far succeeded the assignment that was originally the scope of the website. It was supposed to be a blog setup with roughly 3-5 pages. I'm going to be ending at 20-21 I believe. It's been worth it though! I have gotten so much satisfaction from finishing big chunks... the portfolio section! Wow!! The contact form!! Wow!! How fun!! I usually am anti-tech for most things but I have gotten such an immense amount of satisfaction for finishing web pages I'm thinking I might continue. I am glad this is going to be my actual portfolio website, because I never want to stop. This is endlessly entertaining to me! Yahoo! I wanna mess around more with HTML, CSS and JavaScript graphics... ooooo. I think experimental web graphics are so silly and fun!
