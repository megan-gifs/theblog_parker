      <p>It's funny because usually I hate writing. I don't feel very good at it, I don't feel eloquent, and I struggle to put things in writing that emulate what I'm trying to express. It's a deeply unsatisfactory work for me. Chronologically, this will have been my first blog post. For the time being, I'm going to use this post as a sort of timestamp of progress on my website... partially because I need to fill blog posts for the assignment, but I think it could be fun to track my progress for the website. I was currently working on making a contact form for my website and that was immensely difficult... I ended up using an external tool called web3forms but need to make sure the "success" page for submitting the email on the contact form is a custom design... simply because I think that it would absolutely remove the user from the immersion of the website. I have countless other things I want to tweak... some of it all entirely on the backend that the user would never interface with, when I don't even have the basics done. I have noticed throughout this process I have consistently made this website harder and harder on myself.. adding a further scope with every new edition. Writing this blog is just a reminder of the simpler things I need to finish up. Am I writing this post with not much to say? Possibly. </br></br>
      I eventually want to have this webpage uploaded and hosted on a domain I own, parkerleabo.com, which it might already be on by the time you own this. I think making this website in relation to myself has been an interesting philosophical challenge. Thats my name in the top left corner, and a picture of my face on the about me page. It gets me thinking in the most ridiculous, childish ways. Does this website truly represent me? (...whatever that means) Does the skin, color pallete, navigation, and portfolio represent my work effectively? Is this a website to be proud of? It's funny because it emulates the typical attitudes people have about social media about representation. Except I have complete freedom here. Theres a high likelihood many of my peers won't click through the pages and probably won't care. I think with a lot of my design, especially my personal work I have this strange attitude where the things I make have to 'represent' me or the work I want to do. Is that reasonable? I think sometimes I don't do enough work and spend too much time in my head!</br></br>
      I will say, on a personal note, this is the first time I have made a website I genuinely care about. It has been a deeply satisfying process (except for writing blog posts, ew) to design this website in HTML and CSS. I think the general aesthetic I wanted to channel ended up working extremely well with me learning CSS grids. It's been immensely satisfying to learn things like the moving gradients on other pages and doing the email contact form. I hope I continue to learn new stuff as I continue to build the website. The things I have left to do are make at least 4 (perferably 16) portfolio entries of my existing works, do my entire cv page, write 3 other blog posts over the next few days, and add images to the homepage/portfolio.. and probably like 50 other things that are driving me nuts. Bye!</p>
